## wtlist-demo

This is a demo project intended to showcase my understanding of Laravel. As a demo, some production-grade concerns are intentionally simplified or omitted.

### Notes
- Authentication: The project includes Laravel Breeze scaffolding, but full authentication is not set up nor expected to work. Treat any auth-related code as placeholders for a real implementation.

### The project
- Uses <a href="https://www.wtvehiclesapi.sgambe.serv00.net/api/vehicles" target="blank">https://www.wtvehiclesapi.sgambe.serv00.net/api/vehicles</a> as a resource to import elements from their API, to populate the DB
- Provides a list of ground-based vehicles from the popular MMO title <a href="https://warthunder.com/en" target="blank">War Thunder</a>
- Uses technologies like TailwindCSS for the CSS framework, Livewire for the JavaScript framework, and MySQL for database

> Reminder: Since this is a demo, it's not intended to be deployed, or used in a real world application - It's only meant to showcase my Laravel project
